# Scroll Indicator

This project is a scroll indicator that shows the user how far they have scrolled down the page. It fetches data from an API to populate the page with content.

## Features

- Displays a progress bar at the top of the page that indicates the scroll position.
- Fetches a list of products from the dummyjson API to create a long page to scroll.
- Loading and error states.

## Code

- `index.jsx`: The main component that fetches the data, listens to the scroll event, and updates the scroll indicator.
- `scroll.css`: The styles for the component.
