# Light/Dark Mode

This project demonstrates how to implement a light/dark mode theme switcher using a custom React hook that persists the theme in local storage.

## Features

- Toggle between light and dark themes.
- Persists the selected theme in local storage.
- Uses a custom `useLocalStorage` hook to manage state.

## Code

- `index.jsx`: The main component that displays the theme switcher and applies the current theme.
- `useLocalStorage.jsx`: A custom React hook that allows storing and retrieving data from local storage.
- `theme.css`: The styles for the light and dark themes.
